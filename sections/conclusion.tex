\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we propose a practical approach to classify usefulness of discussion comments in MCR based on VSM similarity.
The results from our case study show that our approach can classify comments with better performance than a random model both for precision and recall.
In addition, we found that 85\% of comments in Gerrit are automatically generated and not likely useful (but important for record keeping).
For the remaining 15\%, about 43\% of them are automatically classified as useful, while about 34\% are classified as not useful.
The remaining 23\% could not be classified by model, and required manual classification.
Thus the classification effort is reduced by about 77\%.

More work could be done in the future to relate the amount of useful comments to the software quality.
This could enable a way of assessing process quality in a quantitative way.
Future work could also consider different models other than semantic similarity.
